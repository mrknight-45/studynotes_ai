### Features to Test

#### üìù Content Generation
1. Try different education levels for the same topic
2. Test various subject areas (science, math, history, literature)
3. Use custom requirements to guide content focus
4. Test regeneration of individual sections

#### üìä Visual Elements
1. Check if diagrams are generated (placeholder images if API doesn't support image generation)
2. Test the expandable sections
3. Review the clean, structured layout

#### üìÑ PDF Export
1. Click "Download PDF" after generating content
2. Test different PDF templates in the note editor
3. Verify formatting and content preservation
4. Check if images are included properly

#### üé® User Interface
1. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
2. Try the topic suggestions feature
3. Test navigation between pages
4. Check error handling with invalid inputs

### Expected Workflow
1. **Dashboard** ‚Üí Welcome screen with quick access
2. **Note Generation** ‚Üí Main content creation interface
3. **Generated Content** ‚Üí Review and interact with AI-created notes
4. **PDF Export** ‚Üí Professional document download
5. **Note Editor** ‚Üí Advanced editing and customization

### Performance Notes
- First generation may take 10-15 seconds
- Subsequent regenerations are typically faster
- PDF generation is nearly instantaneous
- Large topics may require more processing time

### Troubleshooting
- **No content generated**: Check API key configuration
- **PDF not downloading**: Ensure browser allows downloads
- **Slow performance**: Check internet connection and API rate limits
- **Missing diagrams**: Placeholder images are normal if image generation fails

### Demo Tips
1. **Start Simple**: Use basic topics like "Water Cycle" or "Gravity"
2. **Show Variety**: Demonstrate different education levels
3. **Highlight Speed**: Show how quickly professional notes are generated
4. **Demonstrate PDF**: Export and open the PDF to show formatting
5. **Show Regeneration**: Regenerate a section to show AI flexibility
