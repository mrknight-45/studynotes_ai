## Step 5: Sample Use Cases with Mock Content

### Use Case 1: "Acid Rain"

**Input:**
- Topic: "Acid Rain"
- Education Level: Intermediate
- Custom Requirements: "Include chemical formulas and environmental impact"

**Generated Output Structure:**

```markdown
# Study Notes: Acid Rain

## Definition
Acid rain is precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or fog) that has become acidic due to air pollution. It forms when sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are released into the atmosphere and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals.

## Detailed Explanation
**Formation Process:**
- Industrial emissions release SO₂ and NOₓ into the atmosphere
- These gases react with water vapor to form sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃)
- The acidic compounds fall to earth as precipitation with pH below 5.6

**Chemical Reactions:**
• SO₂ + H₂O + ½O₂ → H₂SO₄
• NO₂ + OH → HNO₃

## Key Points
• Normal rain has a pH of 5.6 due to dissolved CO₂
• Acid rain typically has a pH between 4.2-4.4
• Primary sources: coal-burning power plants, automobiles, and industrial facilities
• Most affected regions: Northeast US, Eastern Canada, Scandinavia

## Real-Life Applications
**Environmental Impact:**
- Forest damage: Leaches nutrients from soil, damages tree leaves
- Aquatic ecosystems: Acidifies lakes and streams, harms fish populations
- Infrastructure: Corrodes buildings, monuments, and vehicles
- Human health: Respiratory problems from breathing acidic particles

**Solutions:**
- Clean Air Act regulations
- Scrubber technology in power plants
- Renewable energy adoption
- International cooperation (e.g., Canada-US Air Quality Agreement)

## Summary
Acid rain is a significant environmental problem caused by human activities that release sulfur and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere. It damages ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health, but can be mitigated through pollution control technologies and policy measures.
```

**PDF Export Features:**
- Clean title page with "Acid Rain" heading
- Chemical formulas properly formatted
- Environmental impact diagrams
- Solution flowcharts

### Use Case 2: "Photosynthesis"

**Input:**
- Topic: "Photosynthesis"  
- Education Level: Basic
- Custom Requirements: "Focus on simple explanations for middle school students"

**Generated Output:**

```markdown
# Study Notes: Photosynthesis

## Definition
Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the air.

## Detailed Explanation
**What Plants Need:**
- Sunlight (energy source)
- Water (from roots)
- Carbon dioxide (from air through leaves)
- Chlorophyll (green substance in leaves)

**What Happens:**
Plants capture sunlight with their green leaves and combine it with water and carbon dioxide to create sugar (glucose) and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the air for us to breathe!

## Key Points
• Takes place mainly in leaves
• Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll (makes plants green)
• Produces glucose (plant food) and oxygen
• Happens during the day when there's sunlight
• Very important for all life on Earth

## Real-Life Applications
**Why It Matters:**
- Provides oxygen we breathe
- Food source for all animals (directly or indirectly)
- Removes carbon dioxide from atmosphere
- Plants in your garden, trees in parks, crops on farms

**Examples Around Us:**
- Trees producing oxygen in forests
- Vegetables growing in gardens
- Algae in ponds and oceans
- Houseplants cleaning indoor air

## Summary
Photosynthesis is nature's way of making food and oxygen. Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose and release oxygen, making life possible for all living things on Earth.
```

### Use Case 3: "Law of Conservation of Mass"

**Input:**
- Topic: "Law of Conservation of Mass"
- Education Level: Advanced
- Custom Requirements: "Include mathematical examples and laboratory applications"

**Generated Output:**

```markdown
# Study Notes: Law of Conservation of Mass

## Definition
The Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions. The total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products in a closed system.

## Detailed Explanation
**Historical Context:**
Formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789 through precise quantitative experiments. This principle became fundamental to modern chemistry and the development of atomic theory.

**Mathematical Expression:**
∑(mass of reactants) = ∑(mass of products)

**Molecular Basis:**
At the atomic level, chemical reactions involve rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or destruction. The number and type of atoms remain constant, ensuring mass conservation.

## Key Points
• Applies to all chemical reactions in closed systems
• Foundation for stoichiometric calculations
• Mass defect in nuclear reactions is explained by Einstein's E=mc²
• Apparent violations occur due to gas exchange with environment
• Essential for balancing chemical equations

## Real-Life Applications
**Laboratory Practice:**
- Quantitative analysis and gravimetric methods
- Stoichiometry calculations for reaction yields
- Quality control in pharmaceutical manufacturing
- Environmental monitoring of chemical processes

**Industrial Applications:**
- Chemical reactor design and optimization
- Waste management and recycling processes
- Combustion efficiency calculations
- Materials balance in manufacturing

**Example Calculation:**
2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
(2 × 2.016) + 32.00 = 2 × 18.016
36.032 g = 36.032 g ✓

## Summary
The Law of Conservation of Mass is a fundamental principle that governs all chemical transformations. It enables quantitative predictions, supports atomic theory, and provides the basis for chemical stoichiometry and industrial process design.
